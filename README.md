# Spark

Created by Shuvam Mitra, Soham Das, Angshuman Basu and Sounak Ghosh. It took about 100 hours to complete this project. It definetly includes time we spent laughing over prisms and why try-except in python is absolutely (not) useless.

This is our 12th AISSCE CS Project. The readme might be an overkill, but trust us, the project is not.

### Overview:
- Spark is everything our school library is not. Efficient.
- It is built using Python and SQL, and uses a terminal interface to function.

### How to use:
- Asks the user to log in as an admin or a member.
- Further commands for borrowing/viewing/returning books can be executed from the menu.
- Spark functions as middleware between the Librarian and the student (or anybody else, we don't know). It mimics the whole process of using a library, only through a digital interface so as to minimize errors and help better the traditional library experience.
